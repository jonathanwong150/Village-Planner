Since our 2.3 implementation, we have successfully implemented the logout functionality so users can logout and login as many times as they would like without having to refresh the app, the profile page so users can see the personal info attached to their user profile in our database, a revised queue time calculation algorithm that better accounts for the hour of the day, the popularity of the restaurant, and the opening hours of the restaurant, and added more restaurants into our map so users have a larger range of choices when they use our application.
